Hi! I'm chef Hari Pulapaka. I'm a four-time James Beard Award semifinalist and run a Florida-based restaurant called Cress that's focused on food sustainability. My restaurant has cut down thousands of pounds of food waste over four years, and I also cook and serve the venomous lionfish, an invasive species that's destroying coral reefs off Florida's coast. Oh, and I'm also a math professor (I decided to become a chef somewhat later in life).

Conservationists are encouraging people to eat the lionfish to keep its population in check off the Florida coast. So, I taught AJ+ producer/host Yara Elmjouie how to prepare a few lionfish dishes on the new episode of his show, “In Real Life.” He'll also be here to answer questions. Ask us anything!

Update: Wow, that went by fast! Thank you everyone for your great questions. I'm always down to talk sustainability and what I can do in my role as a chef. If you guys want to see how to prep and cook lionfish, be sure to watch the the latest In Real Life episode.

Please support anything you can to improve the world of food. Each of us has a unique and significant role in crafting a better future for us and future generations. Right now I have to get back to grading exams and running a restaurant. This has been fun!
